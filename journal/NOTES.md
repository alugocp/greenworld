# Units
Nutrient uptake data often comes in varying units, usually pound per acre (lb/A) or pound per bushel (lb/bu).
Sometimes it'll be logged as percentage of crop biomass.

## Conversion
Convert uptake data with the following:
- Identify bu/A
- Identify pound of crop biomass per bushel
- Divide until you end without units (weight of nutrient per weight of crop biomass)
- You'll end with some fraction (convert to percentage) of crop biomass

Note: You'll need to store average biomass of a single unit of each crop

# Additional constraints
- Each species in a companionship fills 1 of 7 (or more) layers, also known as forest layers
  - Canopy layer is over 30 feet, sub-canopy layer is 10 - 30 feet, and shrub layer is up to 10 feet
- Plant sunlight/shade requirements come in three settings: direct sunlight, partial sun, and shade

# Metabolism
- **Metabolic pathway** - a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell
- **Metabolite** - an intermediate result of a metabolic pathway
- **Metabolomics** - the comprehensive measurement of all metabolites in a biological specimen
