# Todo

## Algorithm
- ~~Set up algorithm basics~~
- Write a printer that makes console output easy
- Create an iterator for every combination of species from different niches
- Add some tests for the combinations logic
- Work out the species type (replace instances of species: str with species: Species)
- Write basic companionship reporting algorithms (global and model-based)
- Connect the data to MongoDB database (write new implementations for data output)
- Do dependency injection at some point

## CLI
- ~~Write the CLI to run the core algorithm~~
- Write argument parsing
- Add help and version commands (with usage/credits displayed)
- Allow users to query the companion groups view through the CLI (using SQL?)
