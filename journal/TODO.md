# Todo

## Algorithm
- ~~Set up algorithm basics~~
- ~~Write a printer that makes console output easy~~
- ~~Create an iterator for every combination of species from different niches~~
- ~~Add custom types for readability (Species, Niche and Niches mainly)~~
- Add some tests for the combinations logic
- Work out the species type (have it be more complex than just str)
- Write basic companionship reporting algorithms (global and model-based)
- Connect the data to MongoDB database (write new implementations for data output)
- Do dependency injection at some point
- Add support for ANSII styling with the printer

## CLI
- ~~Write the CLI to run the core algorithm~~
- ~~Write argument parsing~~
- ~~Add help and version commands (with usage/credits displayed)~~
- Allow users to query the companion groups view through the CLI (using SQL?)
