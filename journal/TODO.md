# Todo

## Getting Started
- [x] Set up algorithm basics
- [x] Write a printer that makes console output easy
- [x] Write the CLI to run the core algorithm
- [x] Create an iterator for every combination of species from different niches
- [x] Add custom types for readability (Species, Niche and Niches mainly)
- [x] Run pip for the first time to start using dependencies
- [x] Start linting the code
- [x] Add some tests for the combinations logic
- [x] Work out the species type (have it be more complex than just str)
- [x] Do dependency injection
- [x] Write argument parsing
- [x] Add help and version commands (with usage/credits displayed)

## Algorithm Development and Validation
- [x] Gather a group of species for validation tests
- [x] Write some basic companionship rules
- [x] Write a validation test based on expected companion groups and anti-companion groups
- [x] Find out where to get biochemical pathway data for crops (to see input/output nutrient forms) (perhaps nutrient uptake and nutrient level data)
- [ ] Tweak algorithm rules and add data as needed until tests work
- [ ] Develop a concrete schema for species data

## Expanding on the Algorithm
- [ ] Connect the data to a database (write new implementations for data output)
- [ ] Implement queries by preferred crop(s)
- [ ] Investigate taxonomic granularity (maybe some data can be recorded at the genus or family level, for example)
- [ ] Optimize companion group analysis somehow
- [ ] Start expanding the plant data available to the algorithm
- [ ] Write an outline and rough draft of a paper

## Ready for Publication
- [ ] Implement queries by preferred soil/environment
- [ ] Look for a potential paper publisher
- [ ] Allow users to query the companion groups view through the CLI (using SQL?)
- [ ] Reorganize schema and CLI interface for deployment (if needed)
- [ ] Write second draft of paper with all recent changes in mind
- [ ] Write a YouTube video outline
