# Units
Nutrient uptake data often comes in varying units, usually pound per acre (lb/A) or pound per bushel (lb/bu).
Sometimes it'll be logged as percentage of crop biomass.

## Conversion
Convert uptake data with the following:
- Identify bu/A
- Identify pound of crop biomass per bushel
- Divide until you end without units (weight of nutrient per weight of crop biomass)
- You'll end with some fraction (convert to percentage) of crop biomass

Note: You'll need to store average biomass of a single unit of each crop
